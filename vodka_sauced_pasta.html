    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook the penne pasta according to the package instructions in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until it becomes translucent, about 3-4 minutes.
            Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
            Pour in the vodka and let it simmer for a few minutes, allowing the alcohol to cook off and the sauce to reduce slightly.
            Stir in the crushed tomatoes and simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
            Add the heavy cream and red pepper flakes (if using). Simmer gently over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, about 10-15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked and drained penne pasta to the vodka sauce. Toss gently until the pasta is well coated with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Divide the pasta among serving plates or bowls.
            Garnish with fresh basil leaves and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.
            Serve hot and enjoy your homemade vodka sauce pasta with a side of garlic bread or a simple green salad!</li>
