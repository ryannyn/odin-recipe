    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Filling</h3>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups fresh blueberries, washed and drained</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Topping</h4>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold and cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1/4 cup boiling water</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish with butter or non-stick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, combine the fresh blueberries, granulated sugar, lemon juice, vanilla extract, ground cinnamon, and cornstarch. Gently toss the mixture until the blueberries are well coated. Transfer the blueberry mixture into the prepared baking dish, spreading it evenly.</li>
            <li>
                In another bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the cold butter pieces and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour the boiling water over the mixture and stir until just combined. The batter will be thick and slightly lumpy.</li>
            <li>
                Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler batter evenly over the blueberry filling. It's okay if some of the filling is peeking through. Bake the cobbler in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes or until the topping is golden brown and the blueberry filling is bubbling around the edges.</li>
            <li>
                Remove the cobbler from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Serve the blueberry cobbler warm, optionally topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
