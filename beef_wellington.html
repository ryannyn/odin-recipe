        <li>14 oz. frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <Li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
            Season the beef tenderloin generously with salt and pepper.
            Heat the olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Sear the beef on all sides until it's nicely browned. Remove from heat and let it cool. Brush the beef with Dijon mustard.</Li>
        <Li>In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add mushrooms, shallots, and garlic. Cook until the mushrooms release their moisture and become golden brown. Season with salt and pepper.
            Remove from heat and stir in fresh parsley. Let the mixture cool.</Li>
        <Li>Lay out the prosciutto slices on a sheet of plastic wrap, slightly overlapping.
            Spread the mushroom mixture over the prosciutto.
            Place the seared beef in the center and roll it in the mushroom-prosciutto mixture, using the plastic wrap to tighten and shape it into a log.
            Chill the wrapped beef for 15-20 minutes to firm it up.</Li>
        <Li>Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a size large enough to wrap the beef completely.
            Unwrap the beef from the plastic wrap and place it in the center of the pastry.
            Fold the pastry over the beef, sealing the edges. Trim any excess pastry.
            Brush the entire pastry with the beaten egg for a golden finish.</Li>
        <Li>Place the wrapped beef seam side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
            Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and the beef reaches your desired doneness (use a meat thermometer for accuracy).
            Let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing.</Li>
        <Li>Slice the Beef Wellington into thick portions and serve immediately.</Li>
